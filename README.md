# 🚀 From Zero to Laravel – Self-Learning Journey

A structured journey to learn **PHP and Laravel** from scratch through self-study, practice, and mini-projects. The repository documents code, notes, and progress as I transition from beginner to backend-ready developer.

---

## 📚 Learning Path

* **Course Type**: Self-Education (Online tutorials, documentation, and practice)
* **Goal**: Build proficiency in **Laravel backend development** to become job-ready.
* **Mentorship**: Guided by internship supervisor for task-based learning and review.

## 🎯 Main Objectives

1. Gain strong fundamentals in **PHP & Laravel**.
2. Practice by writing all code **independently** (not copy-pasting).
3. Build projects that prove **real-world backend readiness**.
4. Document each step with commits and notes.
