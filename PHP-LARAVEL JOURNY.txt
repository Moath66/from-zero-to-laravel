PHP-LARAVEL JOURNY


-- Notes

1. How to Get Full Benefits While Practicing by Yourself

1.1-Active Learning (not passive watching):

--Never just watch the videos → code along line by line.

--After finishing each section, delete your code and rebuild from memory. This repetition makes it stick.


1.2-Mini-projects at each stage:

--After learning a feature (e.g., routes, controllers, validation), build a tiny independent project just with that concept.

--Example: After "routes", create a mini router with 5 pages; after "forms", make a contact form.


3-Write notes in your own words:

--Maintain a personal Laravel notebook (Markdown, Notion, or OneNote).

--Include: what problem it solves, example code, when to use it.

4-Version Control from Day 1:

--Use GitHub to push every practice project.


5-After each task:

Explain your process:

--The problem you solved.

--The steps you took (setup, coding, debugging).

--Any challenges & how you fixed them.

(Example: “Here’s the page I opened with Laravel. I set up my local environment using Composer and Artisan. At first, I got an error with XAMPP port, but I solved it by editing php.ini. This shows I can debug issues.”)

6-Document your work and show a clean code structure:

--Organize files, use comments

--Create a README.md file for each project (on GitHub). Add short notes: "This project demonstrates CRUD with Eloquent."

--Be consistent by Notify your supervisor regularly, even if the progress is small (“Task X completed: used Eloquent to create one-to-many relationship. Tested with 5 dummy users. Next, I’ll work on validation.”)

------The moment you can build a CRUD system with authentication + roles, you’re already at a level where many junior backend jobs will consider you ready.

-Add basic token authentication with Laravel Sanctum.(?)



Phase 7: Testing (Week 8)

(Extra Pillar)
